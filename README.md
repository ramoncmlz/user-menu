- When the program starts:
  - The file is read
  - Each line is converted into a **Python dictionary**
  - Users are loaded into memory

- When the program exits:
  - Dictionaries are converted back into text
  - The file is overwritten with updated data

This process was implemented **with the help of AI**, as part of the learning process to understand **how to structure, convert, and persist data between text files and Python data structures**.

## 🎯 Project goal

This project was created to **practice core backend concepts**, such as:

- authentication logic
- state control
- file manipulation
- lists and dictionaries
- validations
- basic security simulation

It is an educational project, but already structured with real-world evolution in mind.
